# Summary

Understanding the behaviour of fluid flow, such as air over a wing, water in a pipeline, or fuel in an engine is crucial in many engineering applications, from designing aircraft and automotive components to optimising energy systems, etc. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) enables engineers to model real-world conditions, optimise designs, and predict performance under a wide range of scenarios, and it has become a vital part of the modern engineering design process for creating efficient, safe, and sustainable designs. As engineers seek to develop and optimise new designs, particularly in fields where there is a drive to push the current state-of-the-art or physical limits of existing design solutions, often, new CFD methodologies or physical models are required. Therefore, extendable and flexible CFD frameworks are needed, for example, to allow seamless integration with machine learning models. In this paper, the features of the  first release of the Julia package XCALibre.jl are presented.  Designed with extensibility in mind, XCALibre.jl is aiming to facilitate the rapid prototyping of new fluid models and to easily integrate with Julia's powerful ecosystem, enabling access to optimisation libraries and machine learning  frameworks to enhance its functionality and expand its application potential, whilst offering multi-threaded performance CPUs and GPU acceleration. 


# Statement of need

Given the importance of fluid flow simulation in engineering applications, it is not surprising that there is a wealth of CFD solvers available, both open-source and commercially available. Well established open-source codes include: OpenFOAM, SU2, CODE_SATURN, Gerris, etc. It is a testament to the open-source philosophy, and their developers, that some of these codes offer almost feature parity with commercial codes. However, the more feature-rich open-source codes have large codebases and, for performance reasons, have been implemented in statically compiled languages which makes it difficult to adapt and incorporate recent trends in scientific computing, for example, GPU computing and interfacing with machine learning frameworks, which is also the case for commercial codes (to a larger extent due to their closed source nature where interfaces to code internals can be quite rigid â€“ although thanks to access to more resources commercial codes have been steadily ported to work on GPUs). As a result, the research community has been actively developing new CFD codes, which is evident within the Julia ecosystem. 

The Julia programming language offers a fresh approach to scientific computing, with the benefits of dynamism whilst retaining the performance of statically typed languages thanks to its just-in-time compilation approach (using LLVM compiler technology). Thus, Julia makes it easy to prototype and test new ideas whilst producing machine code that is performant. This simplicity-performance dualism has resulted in a remarkable growth in its ecosystem offering for scientific computing, which includes state-of-the-art packages for solving differential equations (`DifferentialEquations.jl`), building machine learning models (`Flux.jl`, `Knet.jl` and `Lux.jl`), optimisation frameworks (`JUMP.jl`, XXX and XXX, and more), automatic differentiation (), etc. Likewise, excellent CFD packages have also been developed, most notoriously: `Oceananigans.jl`, which provides tools for ocean modelling, `Trixi.jl` which provides high-order for solvers using the Discontinuous Garlekin method, and `Waterlilly.jl` which implements the immerse boundary method on structured grids using a staggered finite volume method. In this context, `XCALibre.jl` aims to complement and extend the Julia ecosystem by providing a cell-centred and unstructured finite volume general-purpose CFD framework for the simulation of both incompressible and weakly compressible flows. The package is intended primarily for researchers and students, as well as engineers, who are interested in CFD applications using the built-in solvers or those who seek a user-friendly framework for developing new CFD solvers or methodologies. 

# Key features

`XCALibre.jl`, for a young package, is a feature-rich CFD solver. In this section a brief summary of the main features available in version `0.3.x` are highlighted. Users are encouraged to explore the latest version of [the user guide](https://mberto79.github.io/XCALibre.jl/stable/).

* **XPU computation** `XCALibre.jl` is implemented using `KernelAbstractions.jl` which allows it to support both CPU and GPU calculations. 
* **Mesh formats** In `XCALibre.jl` both `.unv ` and `OpenFOAM` mesh formats can be used. When using the `.unv` mesh format both 2D and 3D are supported.`OpenOAM` mesh files can also be converted and used (3D only).
* **Flow solvers** steady and transient solvers are availabe in `XCALibre.jl` using the SIMPLE and PISO algorithms for steady and transient simulations, respectively. Incompressible and weakly compressible (using a sensible energy model) fluids can be simulated.
* **Turbulence models** RANS and LES turbulence models are implemented. RANS models include the standard Wilcox $k-\omega$ model (add ref) and the transitional $k-\omega LKE$ model (add ref). The classic Smagorinsky LES model is also available.
* **VTK simulation output** simulation results are written to `vtk` files for 2D cases and `vtu` for 3D meshs. At present post-processing can only be done in `ParaView`.
* **Miscellaneous** a range of RANs and LES 

# Sample results

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
