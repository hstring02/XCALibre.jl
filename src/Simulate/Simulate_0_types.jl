The `Configuration` type is passed to all flow solvers and provides all the relevant information to run a simulation. 

# Inputs 

* `schemes::NamedTuple` this keyword argument is used to pass distretisation scheme information to flow solvers. See [Numerical setup](@ref) for details.
* `solvers::NamedTuple` this keyword argument is used to pass the configurations for the linear solvers for each field information to flow solvers. See [Runtime and solvers](@ref) for details.
* `runtime::NamedTuple` this keyword argument is used to pass runtime information to the flow solvers. See [Runtime and solvers](@ref) for details.
* `hardware::NamedTuple` this keyword argument is used to pass the hardware configuration and backend settings to the flow solvers. See [Pre-processing](@ref) for details.

# Example

```julia
config = Configuration(
    solvers=solvers, schemes=schemes, runtime=runtime, hardware=hardware)
```

    hardware = set_hardware(backend, workgroup)

Function used to configure the backend.

# Inputs

- `backend` named tuple used to specify the backend e.g. `CPU()`, `CUDABackend()` or other backends supported by `KernelAbstraction.jl`
- `workgroup::Int` this is an integer specifying the number of workers that cooperate in a parallel run. For GPUs this could be set to the size of the device's warp e.g. `workgroup = 32`. On CPUs, the default value in `KernelAbstractions.jl` is currently `workgroup = 1024`.

# Output

This function returns a `NamedTuple` with the fields `backend` and `workgroup` which are accessed by internally in `XCALibre.jl` to execute a given kernel.
